Gigya document

Partner id - The partner ID is your official account number. You'll need this when communicating your account manager or your implementation consultant.
Secret key - The secret key is shared between your sites and your applications and the console.
             Anyone who has access to this key may perform actions on your account
===========================================================

CONSOLE ADMINISTRATION: console overview
===========================================================

Managing admins and user:
*Inviting administrator, to which group to be assigned and priviliges provided
*Adding existing one by the help of user key

===========================================================
Managing applications:
*Create and Manage Applications to Sign Requests to SAP Customer Data Cloud or CDC
*Application keys - are credentials that REST applications use to access CDC’s API
*They are functionally the same as user keys, but with a few differences in that: 
 they are not associated with an account that can log into the admin console, 
 their actions are not recorded by the audit logs, and
 they have higher rate limits than standard site and user keys

API requests to CDC should be made securely using an authentication mechanism.
1.Bearer token - signing request using HTTP bearer token
  The bearer token is sent as a JWT(Jason web token). It is constructed using a unique RSA key provided in the CDC console
2.Use application key and secret key

=============================================================
Permission groups
*Creating permission groups and providing previliges,data feild scope,add members

=============================================================

Identity query tools 

-it is used to retrive the users profile data or metadata
*accounts.search and ids.search we can retrive the user data with api also
*data object feild is the custom feild like newsletter,subscribe
=============================================================
Postman api calls
accounts.search sample queries - accounts.search examples

*The query string clauses must be ordered in the following way*:
1.Select clause
2.From clause
3.Where clause
4.Filter clause
5.Group By clause
6.Order By clause
7.Start clause Or/And Limit clause
 *Queries ordered differently will produce an error.
 
cases
LIMIT 5 START 100 means 5 records after 100
count(*), as ,sum(), min(), max(), avg(), sum_of_squares(), 
variance(), std() ,in() ,is null , is not null ,not ,regex ('<regex-pattern>')(regular expressions)

limit - Using the "LIMIT" clause, you may specify the maximum number of returned result objects. 
If not specified, the default is 300. The maximum number of results that will be returned is 10000;
setting a limit higher than 10000 will have no affect on number of results.
If the search is sent with openCursor = true, LIMIT will set the batch size. LIMIT must be the last item in the query.

start - The "start" clause (not an SQL standard clause) may be used for paging.
The clause specifies the start index from which to return result objects.
The maximum start value accepted is 5000.

Note: Use a POST request rather than GET if you are using a direct REST call.
===================================================================
POSTMAN
CRUD operations
GET-read, POST -create, PUT -update, DELETE -delete.

For post request we need to add the content in jason in body(raw) 
when we are creating response will be 201

Environment we will have the keys and values there
for POST request we need to add the content in the body and PUT aslo ,in jason format

accounts.initregistration a reg token will be generated
that can be used for full registration

===================================================================
LITE registration
*It allows users to subscribe for a newslettrt/competition/vote without requiring registration first
with only email no password required for first time 
when password is provided then it becomes the fully registered one.
*when lite registered we have the account in email account not in account
when fully registererd we get it in accounts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Call accounts.initRegistration with the following parameters
isLite: true
callback: function that passes response data from this call to accounts.setAccountInfo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Call accounts.setAccountInfo with the following minimum parameters received from initRegistration.
regToken
profile: {email:"The user's email"} email should be provided this way only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Call accounts.getLiteToken with the user's email address to receive a token.
Pass that token in the regToken param of accounts.register.along with email and password

and then if we want to finaliize finalizeRegiatration as true.

=========================================================================
Screen-Sets
we can create new screen set from scratch in HTML code 
Or use the existing one but we should clone and use it if not under advanced customization 
the previous one will be lost. 

for the screens check in the documentation for the demo code 
*it can be done by pasting the code in the htdocs of the apache server in localhost

customer identity implementation methods

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAAS policies
Registration as a services policies allow you as the Gigya console administrator to
 define the site policies and settings for user registration and login.
========================================================================
WEBSDK:
add the following code to your sites header template.
<script type="text/javascript" lang="javascript" src="cdns.<Data_Center>/js/gigya.js?apikey=<A_Valid_API_Key_For_Your_Site>">
</script>

Subscribing to Events:
function displayEventMessage(eventObj) {
    alert(eventObj.context + ' ' + eventObj.eventName);
}
gigya.socialize.addEventHandlers({
    onError: displayEventMessage,
});
gigya.accounts.addEventHandlers({
    onError: displayEventMessage,
});

Calling the Method:
gigya.<namespace>.<method_name>(params);
// e.g., gigya.socialize.showShareBarUI(params)
===================================================================
social Login:
we do have social login demo.
client side means websdk , server side means rest api
we do have different basic code and demo codes for the same in documentation.
==================================================================
DATA flows (identity sync),sftp(secure file transfer protocol)

dataflows for exporting and importing user data
*IdentitySync SAP Customer Data Cloud's solution for transferring data between platforms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *it's the go-to place for integrating your user data into third party systems
*In addition, it's used for migrating users between two different CDC sites and for importing user data into CDC 
*it's used for migrating users between two different CDC sites and for importing user data into CDC
*A component is a preconfigured unit that is used to perform a specific data integration operation.
*The components include readers, writers, transformers, deleters, and look-ups
Each component is responsible for performing a single task,
such as extracting accounts from SAP Customer Data Cloud based on specific parameters,
changing field names, creating a CSV file, uploading a file to FTP and 
writing data directly to a target platform or sending it to a generic API endpoint

steps:
1.check for accounts in identity access 
2.if there are no accounts 
3. then we should prepare a jason file with user
4.The users must have a UID field which will identify them in the CDC database
5. If they don't, we could add a step in identity sync that generates random UIDs
6,Create a new data flow and select Gigya with SFTP. We're going to import full accounts from SFTP and press continue
provide all the required information of the feilds there
after providing the information hit save and close.
We can run a test to see if our flow is defined correctly
we can set a scheduler 
in log level we can choose error log,info log, debug log.
we can set the number of records to get default is 3 we can also provide the email to show up the success or failure.

4 status of job run
succeeded, completed with errors, failed and stopped
and finally we can check that job id will be added in the custom feild in the profile data.

Data flow 
Dataflows are the SAP Customer Data Cloud robust ETL solution (Extract, Transform, Load) that offers an easy way to transfer data in bulk between platforms.
*shared variables:You may create and manage variables, that can be shared in different dataflows within the same site, 
 the same data center or across all partner sites
we can create shared variables accordingly if not required we can delete it.
*Shared variables are case sensitive.
//Note that Dataflow jobs are scheduled in UTC time

Value placeholders:
apikey,now(VendorName_${now:yyyyMMddssSSS}.csv),unix(The timestamp of the time at which the record was processed, in seconds. Example: 1543243596),jobid


DATASOURCE:
datasource.read components extract data from a platform(max 2 gb)
datasource.write components upload data to a target platform(max50gb if it exceeds then we can make changes in maxconcurrency)
datasource.lookup components extract data from a platform based on a field from another data source.
datasource.delete components delete information from the target platform (e.g., a user record).


custom scripts(record.evaluate)
*offers you the option of writing your own custom scripts to use in a dataflow
Code	Behavior in GraalVM	Behavior in Nashorn
undefined === null	'true'	'false'
undefined !== null	'false'	'true'
"Test script" can be used for finding logical errors in the code

 Use this parameter only when the script produces a large number of records
function process(record, ctx, logger, next, error) {next.accept(record, record);
}

error: sends a failed record to the error path (for example, for writing to a separate file). Example:
function process(record, ctx, logger, next, error) {error.accept(record, record);
}

In the above syntax (record, record), the first 'record' is the new data, after manipulation. 
The second 'record' is the original one, and is used in error paths.


==============================================================================================
Consent statements:

*3Types of consent statements Terms of Service, Privacy Policies and Other Consent Statements
*Consent statements are created and configured only on the parent site, and activated or de-activated for individual child sites
*ID is the feild name created in the schema.
*once the new consent is saved, the value of the ‘Versioning By’ field cannot be changed.
The value of the ‘effective as of field’ will be written against the customer’s account data when they register.
The re-consent cut-off value controls the document versioning process and supports both major and minor versioning
*we can add a localized consent template
You can also add Custom Data to the consent statement
*Up to 50 key/value pairs can be created per consent statement
Terms of service consent statements are always prepended with the word ‘terms’ and
privacy policy consent statements are always prepended with ‘privacy’.
*add a checkbox to the screen-set and map the checkbox to the isConsentGranted property of the consent schema field
Under the meta data we can add the tags, useful when we can know on which screen the consent is granted on screens.

*SAP Customer Consent is our offering for managing user privacy, preferences and consent in a way that is transparent to the user, 
while helping you uphold rigorous standards so as to support your compliance with international privacy regulations
*we can create the consent in consent statements by id and by providing the url
*then we can map it in the ui builder by chekbox >map feild>label one
* we need to create consent for registartion,registration completion,
*If Screen sets cannot be used, we could use APIs to realize the consent logic.
by api calls accounts.notifyLogin REST >accounts.setAccountInfo REST(This endpoint accepts the regToken returned from the accounts.notifyLogin)>
 accounts.finalizeRegistration(use same regtoken)

=============================================================================================

SAML 

*Security assertion markup language(SAML) is an XML based,open std data format for exchanging authentication and autherization data between entities.
*In simple terms, SAML is a std for federating login/logout to a third party. 

Idp - this authenticates the user.
sp -the entity which needs a user authenticated before they provide service to that user.
Assertion - After authentication the idp provides user data to the SP by including assertions in the Response XML.
x.509 certificate - SAML uses X.509 certificates for signatures and encryption.

*In connect under identity we go to outbound federation> saml
*Then under configure SAML identity providers to put the proxy page URL and error page URL
*Then under the SAML Idp Metadata provide the required data in Metadata URL we get the sso link,slo link ,entity id and x509 certificate in XML format

*Then in inbound federation we provide all the data for the SAML as service provider.

*In order to complete an integration there are 4 pages which must be created
1.login page 2.logout page 3.proxy page 4.error page
all four of the HTML pages are created
